### Project name/link: RHINOS SPACE SHOOTER

### Project Description: 
Reverse-engineering of the old-school arcade game Space Invaders!

### Project Story: 
This project started out as a little seed of an idea based on a resource someone posted in the #general chat, and grew into a wild jungle of an adventure with people from damned near every continent working together to build a classic arcade game…WHAT?! (ya I know, we’re not normal ;p) 
 
We kicked off the first project meeting with…around 20 people! We rallied around one version of the game and collectively managed to get a features list set and loaded up in Trello (project management tool). Those features were translated into tasks and we formed pairs to work on the tasks. 

With the amount of people we had working on that project, it’s a miracle anything got finished. It was a fun ride, though!
